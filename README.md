# BlinkIT-Grocery-Sales-Inventory-Analysis
Analyzed BlinkIT's grocery data using Excel to identify trends in sales performance, product demand, and stock levels. This project aimed to support business decisions related to inventory planning and category-level optimization.

    Cleaned and structured raw data to remove duplicates and handle missing values.

    Created pivot tables and charts to visualize top-selling products, monthly revenue, and low-stock alerts.

    Segmented performance by product category and time periods for deeper insights.

    Helped understand customer buying behavior and stock turnover rates.

This project enhanced my skills in data analysis, Excel visualization, and business reporting.
